# DeepSix
DeepSix is an open source personal dive logbook for recreational (non-decompression) scuba diving.
** Use at your own risk and always double check divetable calculations with tables that you trained with!! ** The tables used in the auto-complete feature are based off the NOAA recreational dive tables, and I do not claim any rights to said tables.
